* Working notes

** supervisor

   - installed with apt
   - fixed permissions error by

     #+BEGIN_SRC conf
       [unix_http_server]
       file=/var/run/supervisor.sock   ; (the path to the socket file)
       chmod=0766                       ; socket file mode (default 0700)
     #+END_SRC


** Design

*** DONE Tailer
    script that continually tails

    ~gdbus monitor --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path
    /timepp/zagortenay333/Pomodoro~

    and logs into a sqlite db

    why:

    - easy to query
    - structured
    - don't need to make different files for each window etc.

*** Beeminder

    script that runs periodically*, queries the time spent in pomodoro
    state in the interval, and logs to beeminder

    - track last run in the same db (since we need to query it anyway)

    - periodic runs: we'll do this with cron - supervisord can do a
      limited version of periodic tasks if you write an event listener
      that listens for TICK_60 for example, but this seems convoluted
      and unnecessary. We just need to make sure the beeminder script
      can track last success
