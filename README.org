* supervisor

  - installed with apt
  - fixed permissions error by

    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
      [unix_http_server]
      file=/var/run/supervisor.sock   ; (the path to the socket file)
      chmod=0766                       ; socket file mode (default 0700)
    #+END_SRC


* Design

** Tailer
   script that continually tails

   ~gdbus monitor --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path
   /timepp/zagortenay333/Pomodoro~

   and logs into a sqlite db

   why:

   - easy to query
   - structured
   - don't need to make different files for each window etc.

** Beeminder

   script that runs periodically, queries the time spent in pomodoro
   state in the interval, and logs to beeminder

   - track last run in the same db? multiple writers?
